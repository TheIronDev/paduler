A Puzzle & Dragonsâ„¢ Stamina Scheduler, made with `Express` for the backend, and `Redux` for the backend.

Its purpose is to provide a utility that lets users schedule how and when they will enter dungeons
in the Puzzle & Dragons game throughout the day.

This is very much an experimental webapp that I am writing, I'm mostly trying to play around with `Redux` and `svg`s,
but hey, maybe this will be useful to someone. :)
